This project was created during [Godot Wild Jam #10](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-10) as a means of learning the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

The release for Glitch in the System turned out as an unfinished, but decent foundation, to a game that could be genuinely fun. When jumping into the Godot Wild Jam, I came in with a single goal, learn the Godot engine. Lucky for me, I accomplished that goal. I went from struggling to move an object to coding map generation within the week. Unfortunately, much of the time spent poking at procedural map generation affected the time that would have gone to other core mechanics such as combat.

The project also suffers from some messy code that could use some improvement. As this code was made in a jam with nearly no experince in the engine, there were a few design differences that my Unity experince did not prepare me for.
